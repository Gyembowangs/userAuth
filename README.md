Explanation
In this practical, we build a Semester Registration System for Sherubtse College using the MVC architecture and including Node.js, Express.js, EJS, and PostgreSQL. In this practical, the main task was to put in place a safe way for users to log in, create an account, verify their email, log in again, reset their password, and recover their password, which are all important features for managing registration.
In the beginning, we install a dependencies such as express, pg, dotenv, bcryptjs, jsonwebtoken, nodemailer, and others through npm. For this, a directory structure was put in place where MVC groupedn for controllers, models, views, and routes. The function in userModel.js created the PostgreSQL users table using SQL to find it in the model. Some of the fields in the table are id, username, email, password, role, is_verified, and tokens for email and password verification. In order to ensure security, environment variables are used to set up the database connection in the separate db.js file.
All the major logic for authentication is handled in the authentication controller. When registering, the user’s password is converted into a hashed form by bcryptjs, and a verification token is created with jsonwebtoken. After the email is sent to the user through nodemailer with a verification link, clicking on it will change the user’s status to is_verified = true. To use the portal, a person needs to log in and the portal checks if the person is authorized and if the email is validated. To reset their password, users have to request a reset link sent to their registered email address, and clicking on the link automatically opens a form for updating their account’s password. Just like with email verification, the tokens are used for security and to set their expiry date.

Login, signup, forgot password, reset password, and the landing pages are built by EJS. Forms in these views POST data to the necessary routes. A default CSS stylesheet is connected to provide the same clean and uniform style on all pages. Essential routing is handled through Express, as all of the GET and POST requests for user actions are defined in authRoutes.js. The server settings in app.js use session and cookie filters, manage static files, define the view engine, and make sure the PostgreSQL user table is set automatically at the very beginning.

Finally, this practical enable backend configuration that allows implementing a secure authentication system, making it possible to later add student, faculty, and admin roles. Having email verification and hashed passwords is evidence that good security and development practices are used. Now, the main focus is to add other features such as registering for semesters, selecting subjects, and admin control pages.
